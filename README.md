# Webdev–1 Zoo Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **web development exercise** focused on building and deploying a modern, responsive web application.  
The assignment was to create a fictional zoo website with semantic HTML, responsive layout using **CSS Grid/Flexbox**, and basic interactivity in **JavaScript** (search, filters, and “Visa mer” details).

The site demonstrates:

- ✅ Semantic HTML structure (`header`, `main`, `aside`, `section`, `article`, `footer`)
- ✅ Responsive design (1 column on mobile, 4 columns on larger screens)
- ✅ JavaScript interactivity (search, type filter, clear button, info alerts)
- ✅ Clean file structure (`css/`, `js/`, `images/`, `pages/`)

---

## 🖥️ Features

- **Zoo showcase**: Presents animals with name, type, color, description, and birth year.
- **“Visa mer” button**: Displays full animal information via a JavaScript alert.
- **Responsive layout**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
